## Getting started

Galactic Express (GalEx) is a 100% on-chain PvE economic game.

Deliver 📦 cargo to the orbit using ⛽️ fuel efficiently

## Stages
1. Registration.

The stage is initialized by the admin.

Session contract generates random risk factors, payload reward and fuel price.

During the registration stage participants have to specify:
- the amount of fuel they're willing to buy for the exact session;
- payload weight.

2. Execution.

The stage is initialized by the admin.

The game is managed by a session contract that executes the session within 1 block.

Session contract creates random events based on the risk factor of the session.

Fuel burn rate = *strategy.payload / total_rounds*

Participants can review the log using the dApp page [title](https://www.example.com).

## Risk factor

Risk types effect the mission probability.

| Type | Failure probability |
| --- | ----------- |
| 🚫 Engine error | 3% |
| 🛤 Trajectory failure | 3% |
| 🚀 Separation error | 3% |
| 🗿 Asteroid | 10% + weather |
| ⛽ Fuel > 80% | 10% + weather |
| 📦 Payload > 80% | 10% + weather |

Weather affects the probability multipliers.

| Fuel tank = 0 | Session reward * 1.7x |
| Fuel tank > 0 | Session reward * 0.5x..1.4x |
