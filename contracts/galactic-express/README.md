# [Galactic Express](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/examples/Gaming/galactic-express)

Galactic Express (GalEx) is a 100% on-chain PvE economic game.

Deliver the cargo 📦 to the orbit 🌌 using fuel ⛽️ efficiently.

### 🏗️ Building

```sh
cargo b -r -p "galactic-express*"
```

### ✅ Testing

```sh
cargo t -r -p "galactic-express*"
```

## Stages

### 1. Registration

Contract generates random risk factors, the payload reward, and the fuel price.

During this stage participants have to specify:
- an amount of fuel they're willing to buy for this session.
- a payload weight.

### 2. Execution

> This stage can be started only by the admin.

Contract executes a session within 1 transaction and creates random events during it based on risk factors of the session.

### 3. The end game

The main goal is to deliver a cargo to the orbit without the fuel surplus/shortage and with the bypass of fatal events. If a player has lots of remaining fuel, a delivery reward increases.

## Math

### Fuel burn rate

`= (Payload weight + 2 * Weather factor) / Turns)`

### Risk factor

Risk types effect the mission probability.
