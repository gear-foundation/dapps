# Sails Syndote

Sails Syndote is a Monopoly-inspired game where the players are automated programs that compete and strategize to dominate the game board. Each player represents a program, creating a unique experience as they navigate the game autonomously. A sample player program is available at this [link](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/contracts/syndote/player).

A detailed description of the project can be found on the [wiki](https://wiki.vara.network/docs/examples/Gaming/monopoly).

⚙️ **Note**: The project code is developed using the [Sails](https://github.com/gear-tech/sails) framework.
