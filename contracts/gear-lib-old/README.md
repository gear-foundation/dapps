# Old Gear library

> This library is planned to be deprecated and replaced by the new [Gear library]. It's still used in many contract interacting with tokens in this repository, but if you want to implement your own token contracts, please use the new [Gear library].

[Gear library]: ../gear-lib

Token primitives, helpers for contracts, and everything else that wasn't included in `gstd`.

### ⚙️ Usage

Include the following line under the `[dependencies]` table in your contract's `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
gear-lib = { git = "https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps", tag = "v1.0.2" }
gear-lib-derive = { git = "https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps", tag = "v1.0.2" }
```
