## Description

React application of [Tamagotchi](https://github.com/gear-dapps/tamagotchi) based
on [Rust smart-contract](https://github.com/gear-dapps/tamagotchi).

## Getting started

### Install packages:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Declare environment variables:

Create `.env` file, `.env.example` will let you know what variables are expected.

In order for all features to work as expected, the node and it's runtime version should be chosen based on the
current `@gear-js/api` version.

In case of issues with the application, try to switch to another network or run your own local node and specify its
address in the `.env` file. When applicable, make sure the smart contract(s) wasm files are uploaded and running in this
network accordingly.

### Run the app:

```sh
yarn start
```
